# Spartan_3_sdram_ftf_driver

Spartan-3E Xilinx's FPGA TFT driver design with SDRAM and UART user interface supported.

The TFT model that is using in this design is AT070N92/94 or AT050Nxxx.

This controller support 8 display frames, which utilize the internal SDRAM 4 Banks (2 bits) and MSb of the Row address.

Please feel free to pull requests, update, and improve the design.

Have fun~ =]
